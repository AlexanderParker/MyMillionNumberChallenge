Million Number Challenge Attempt 3 - FAILED
===========================================

This time I thought I'd get the better of those pesky digits using basic division.

Surely inside all those numbers there would be just one that was perfectly divisible, and where the storage size of the quotient and divisor were smaller than the whole.

The way I tried to figure it, 100 / 2 is 4 numbers.  To reverse it, 2 * 50 is only 3 numbers.  If I could find a combination of numbers that resulted in a large enough saving to account for the storage of the information, then I would be onto something for sure.

Requires PHP 5.6 and gmp.
