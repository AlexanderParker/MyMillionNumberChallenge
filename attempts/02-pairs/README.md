Million Number Challenge Attempt 2 - INCOMPLETE
===============================================

I started on this idea to find runs of numbers at a certain distance apart, e.g.

929481928912948

Number 9 at offset 0 repeats 3 times separated by distance of 5.

Maybe if I can find runs that are longer than the space needed to describe them, I can succeed!

Or, more likely, there won't be any such runs and the case will remain unsolved.
