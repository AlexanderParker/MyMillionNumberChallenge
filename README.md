What is this?
=============

This will catalogue my attempts to grapple with the million number challenge.

At the very least I'm hoping to provide some entertainment values as my feeble
mind battles concepts beyond its puny understanding.

I hope also to provide some insights for people who, like me, go "That doesn't
sound so hard does it?  Why not just <blah>?" by offering practical examples of
what doesn't work.

If any mathematicians happen by who can explain the "why" behind my failings,
I'd be much obliged.

It's cold and windy outside tonight...  I feel the urge to try another
hare-brained compression algorithm...

I'll be back.
