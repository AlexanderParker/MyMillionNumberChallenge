What is this?
=============

This will catalogue my attempts to grapple with the million number challenge.

At the very least I'm hoping to provide some entertainment values as my feeble
mind battles concepts beyond its puny understanding.

I hope also to provide some insights for people who, like me, go "That doesn't
sound so hard does it?  Why not just <blah>?" by offering practical examples of
what doesn't work.

If any mathematicians happen by who can explain the "why" behind my failings,
I'd be much obliged.

It's cold and windy outside tonight...  I feel the urge to try another
hare-brained compression algorithm...

I'll be back.

Just some quick thoughts on my efforts so far.

Mathematics for me has always been a kind of abstract concept - wishy-washy,
numbery-wumbery kind of... stuff.  Part of my motivation jumping into this was
to learn, and learn I have.

Certainly I've come at this problem from a number of angles.  As I continue I
begin to appreciate just how _physical_ numbers really are.

Talking to colleagues about the problem, a common pattern is for "common sense"
to prevail, "surely it's simple as" (rings a few bells as to my previous sense
of denial).

Concepts like representing the data in terms of what it's "not" or finding 
some kind of nested index or tree representation. I encourage them to consider
the branches of that tree are themselves information, the format of the index -
indeed the size of the offsets probably larger than the indexed information.

Any way you could skew each digit into another form requires a map to get back,
and when your data is completely random, the map ends up being just another
way of looking at the same data.

Granted I've had some successes on various files, text files and some image
formats are somewhat compressible using the mathematical or token-based tricks
I've tried to-date. However on the random data my most successful attempts 
either increase the filesize, or the result is exactly the same size to the bit.

My other attempts have been miserable failures.

I'm a stubborn bastard, and now my co-workers have a side bet going on my
chances of success.  They put the odds at 1-1000...

I'd say they're more 1-infinity.

Yet I persevere.  A guy's gotta have a hobby I guess!
